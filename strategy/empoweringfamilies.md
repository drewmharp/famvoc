#### Empower Families
The Clinic listens to Families and provides information about legal rights, resources and
strategies. Families are empowered to identify their priorities and preferences as to what works
best for them. Families also grow in Resilience and self-care, as they advocate for themselves.

#### Community Partners
Challenges Families experience in accessing community supports are an opportunity to build
more collaborative Relationships with community partners. Ongoing Reflection allows all
concerned to make adjustments as needed to be successful.
