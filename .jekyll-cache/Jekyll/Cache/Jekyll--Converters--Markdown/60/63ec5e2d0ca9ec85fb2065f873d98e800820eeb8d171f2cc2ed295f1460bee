<blockquote>
  <p>See juvenile court from the Family‚Äôs perspective.  Set in New York City, this video highlights  principles that apply to any Family. Parents, Grandparents and Caregivers, you are the most important person in your loved one‚Äôs life!  You know this child better than anyone else!<br />
So go to court with your child, or send a relative/friend when you cannot attend.  This child needs to know you are there for them, no matter what!
Talk to your child, the Probation Officer and your child‚Äôs lawyer. Be open to asking questions and learn about the different options or programs. Share what you think.
Get support and take care of yourself. This is hard! 
Don‚Äôt give up on your child -  no matter what.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Youth Survey (PAYS)   gathers data from Pennsylvania students about their behavior and attitudes around violence, alcohol and other drugs.  PAYS provides critical information on behaviors and patterns of use, but more importantly it assesses risk factors related to use and the protective factors that help guard against them.  ‚ÄúProtective factors, also known as ‚Äúassets,‚Äù are conditions that buffer children and youth from exposure to risk by either reducing the impact of the risks or changing the way that young people respond to risks. Protective factors identified through research include strong bonding to family, school, community and peers. These groups support the development of healthy behaviors for children by setting and communicating healthy beliefs and clear standards for children‚Äôs behavior. Young people are more likely to follow the standards for behavior set by these groups if the bonds are strong. Strong bonds are encouraged by providing young people with opportunities to make meaningful contributions, by teaching them the skills they need to be successful in these new opportunities, and by recognizing their contributions. Risk factors are conditions that increase the likelihood of a young person becoming involved in drug use, delinquency, school dropout and/or violence. For example, children living in families with poor parental monitoring are more likely to become involved in these problems.‚Äù  See Communities That Care: Risk and Protective Factors, p. 1.</p>

<p>The Juvenile Justice Section of the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency selects strategies proven to help communities stress prevention, and promotes ways to improve Pennsylvania‚Äôs juvenile justice system.</p>

<p>The Center for Court Innovation‚Äôs  YOUTH PROGRAMS  provide young people with meaningful alternatives to the formal justice system and engage youth voices to improve justice for all.</p>

<p>The  Juvenile Justice and Youth section of the Council of State Governments works with communities across the country to adopt policies and practices shown to reduce recidivism and improve other youth outcomes.</p>

<p>The School to Prison Pipeline  is causing communities to re-think how we should view and address classroom behaviors.  Cracking down on students and failing to provide needed supports has long lasting effects, and predominantly effects children of color.  It starts as early as pre-school and strongly impacts the family, economy and school systems. Seventy percent of children in the juvenile justice system struggle with issues related to mental health, learning differences, neglect or trauma.  Seventy percent of children in the juvenile justice system end in the the adult criminal justice system.   Time to reallocate resources out of criminal justice and into our school system so we can be smarter in assessing the needs of students and their families, and responding in the right way.
