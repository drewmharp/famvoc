I"À<p>Preventing and stopping bullying requires a commitment from parents, teachers, school administrators and students.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWhen adults respond quickly and consistently to bullying behavior they send the message that it is not acceptable. Research shows this can stop bullying behavior over time. Parents, school staff, and other adults in the community can help kids prevent bullying by talking about it, building a safe school environment, and creating a community-wide bullying prevention strategy.‚Äù   <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/">Stopbullying.gov</a></p>

<p>Some studies show that one out of three children are bullied.  So Parents, talk to your child everyday, and occasionally ask them if they or someone they know is having problems at school.  If there is bullying, tell your child that adults are here to help.  Call your child‚Äôs teacher and principal, schedule a meeting, talk about the Bullying, and develop a strategy to stop it.</p>
