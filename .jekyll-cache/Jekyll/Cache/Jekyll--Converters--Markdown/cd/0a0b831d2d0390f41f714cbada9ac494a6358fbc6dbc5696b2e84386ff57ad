<p>Developing values and ‚Äúbeliefs to live by‚Äù will lead to finding your life‚Äôs purpose and bring happiness and success into our lives. Visualize, practice and pray for growth in these timeless values:</p>

<p><strong>Integrity:</strong>
 Honesty, adherence to moral values and trustworthiness inspire confidence in other people. We all make mistakes. Admit when you are on a wrong course, seek advice and make adjustments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúLive so that when your children think of fairness, caring and integrity, they think of you.‚Äù ‚Äê H. Jackson Brown, Jr.</p>

<p><strong>Perseverance:</strong> Strength, wisdom and courage to do what is right regardless of the difficulty or consequences. Perseverance does not mean going it alone. Wisdom tells us that we all need the support of others. It just takes a little humility and courage to seek that support.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúNever stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place ‚Äì that is, the unique you. Have an aim in life, continuously acquire knowledge, work hard and have perseverance to realize the great life.‚Äù ‚Äê A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Faith:</strong> Faith is belief and trust in God. Faith seeks understanding and relationship with God. Faith is tested by life‚Äôs hardships. To grow in your personal beliefs, explore spiritual readings or a faith community that you connect with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúFaith is taking the first step even when you don‚Äôt see the whole staircase.‚Äù ‚Äê Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hope:</strong> Cultivate an expectation of goodness in your life. Let go of negative thought patterns. Develop a plan for your life goals, embrace a spirit of gratitude and seek out new opportunities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúHope is an adventure, a going forward ‚Äì a confident search for a rewarding life.‚Äù ‚Äê Karl Menninger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Love Others:</strong> Make caring for others a part of your daily life. Practice being kind, thoughtful and generous to the people you care about or meet throughout your day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe way to get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.‚Äù ‚Äê Mitch Albom.</p>
