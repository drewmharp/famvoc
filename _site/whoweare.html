    <main>
<p>The Family Advocacy Clinic of Voice and Vision, Inc., provides expert advocacy support to individuals and families facing a myriad of issues.  Our multi-discipline approach utilizes the skills of legal, social work and educational professionals and interns.  The Clinic is a “Family-Led Organization” following the core principle that the family experience and perspective must play an important role in developing family-centered supports and systems of care.  
</p>

<p>For students at Delaware County Community College and their families, the Clinic provides advocacy support on any issue, such as immigration, landlord tenant, custody, child support, pardons, criminal justice, domestic violence and social justice issues related to the “school to prison pipeline.”  Since 2016, Delaware County Community College has generously supported the Clinic by providing staff-time, office space, computers and other in-kind donations.  
</p>

<p>The Clinic also supports families in the broader community who are facing challenges with respect to “school to prison pipeline” social justice issues, including special education, bullying, school discipline, truancy, dependency, juvenile justice, trauma, mental health and substance use disorder.
