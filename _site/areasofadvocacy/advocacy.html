  <li><ins>Learn Information:</ins><br />

<h4 id="why-you-must-advocate-for-your-family">Why You Must Advocate For Your Family</h4>
<p>You must advocate for your family because when children’s learning or health problems are not addressed, children can quickly go backwards in terms of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self-image ‐ viewing themselves as stupid or a failure.</li>
  <li>School performance ‐ poor grades can hurt their chances to graduate or attend college.</li>
  <li>Relationships ‐ isolate or choose negative peers.</li>
  <li>Behavior ‐ bullying, suspensions, expulsions, truancy and arrest.</li>
</ul>

Through Advocacy, Families enhance their children’s ability to build strong healthy relationships and a brighter future. Family Advocacy will:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Strengthen Schools:
Schools can focus on standardized education and discipline instead of meeting your child’s special education and behavioral needs. Advocacy protects your child’s right to an appropriate education and helps prevent negative outcomes.</li>
  <li>Strengthen Behavioral Health:
One in four teenagers has a mental health problem. Ninety percent of addicts are diagnosable during the teen years. Early intervention and access to quality care are crucial. Advocacy helps your child receive care when its needed.</li>
  <li>Strengthen Juvenile Justice:
Most children in the juvenile justice system have learning challenges related to disabilities, ADHD, anxiety, depression, emotional problems or trauma. Substance abuse is also common. Advocacy allows Family concerns to be heard and addressed.</li>
  <li>Strengthen Families:
Improving self-care, family relationships and community supports will strengthen your Family.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="practical-tips">Practical Tips</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Be Organized:
Keep copies of all your papers and contact information in a folder or binder.</li>
  <li>Communications Log:
Make notes of any conversations, phone calls, emails or meetings with people in the system, i.e. school, healthcare or juvenile justice personnel. Include the date, as well as the names and job titles of the people involved.</li>
  <li>Meeting Preparation:
Prepare for meetings by making a list of topics you want to discuss and the goals or results you want to achieve. What do you want this system to do for your child and when? During the meeting, take notes on what was discussed and the people who attended (name and job title).</li>
  <li>Be Polite:
Be a respectful advocate. If you get upset, take some time to self-care before forging ahead.</li>
</ul>
