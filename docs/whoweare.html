<p>The Family Advocates of Voice and Vision, Inc., provides expert advocacy support to individuals and families facing a myriad of issues related to the “school to prison pipeline.” Our multi-discipline approach utilizes the skills of legal, social work and educational professionals and interns. The Family Advocates supports families dealing with challenges in special education, bullying, school discipline, truancy, dependency, juvenile justice, trauma, mental health and substance use disorder.</p>

<p>In addition to supporting families, we engage in “Systems Advocacy” to effect broader social impact through institutional improvements and innovation. All advocacy services are free.</p>

<p>Launched in 2016, the Family Advocates is very grateful for the generosity of all our supporters without whom we would not exist.</p>
