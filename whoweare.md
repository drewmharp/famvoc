The Family Advocacy Center of Voice and Vision, Inc., in partnership with Delaware County Community College, provides expert advocacy support to individuals and families facing a myriad of issues.  Since 2016, Delaware County Community College has generously supported the Center by providing staff-time, office space, computers and other in-kind donations.

Our multi-discipline approach utilizes the skills of legal, social work and educational professionals and interns.  For students at Delaware County Community College and their families, the Center provides advocacy support on any issue, such as immigration, landlord tenant, custody, child support, pardons, criminal justice, domestic violence and social justice issues related to the “school to prison pipeline.”  The Center supports families in the broader community who are facing challenges with respect to “school to prison pipeline” social justice issues, including special education, bullying, school discipline, truancy, dependency, juvenile justice, trauma, mental health and substance use disorder. 

In addition to supporting families, the Center engages in "Systems Advocacy" to effect broader social impact through institutional improvements and innovation.
